We’re kicking off our employee spotlight, chatting with Ted Gould. Ted is an engineer here at Axiom and was our first employee.

## How did you find out about Axiom?

The previous project I was working on was coming to an end, and so I was looking for opportunities. As part of that, I reached out to some old friends who said “we’re working on this thing, we hope to have a company soon.” So I took a few months of severance and became familiar with what they were doing, and got some things done around the house, then started when the company got established.

## What do you think about working from home?

I love working from home and I was definitely looking for a new WFH opportunity when searching for a new job. I know that the Axiom folks understood WFH and so they’d get it right, which makes all the difference. A lot of people have been forced into WFH because of the pandemic, but we’re going to find out who really embraced the change and who was forced into it in the next little while. WFH can be bad if you’re in an organization that doesn’t understand it.

## What advice would you give to someone new to WFH?

I like to think about it less as “Work From Home” and more as “Work From an Undisclosed Location.” Get out. Work from a park, or a back yard, or a pool, or wherever. Mix it up. Understand that you do have some flexibility and embrace that.
