**In this post, I will walk you through creating and using dashboards in Axiom to easily visualize, monitor, and share your data.**

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial, you will need:

- Access to an [Axiom deployment](https://www.axiom.co/download/), or be running Axiom locally via the Axiom Demo (works on Linux, macOS, and Windows).

- One or more datasets with log data [ingested](https://docs.axiom.co/usage/ingest/) into Axiom.

## When to Use Dashboards

Dashboards consist of Queries which can individually access any dataset the user has access too. Each query can visualize one or more charts, which are grouped together to create the dashboard.

Users have full control over the size and position of each query and the charts they produce. There is also a special chart called “Statistic”, which displays a number + bar chart in a large detail.

### Here are some of the uses for dashboards:

- Visualize different datasets in one place to get an overview across multiple streams of data. 
- Group collections of queries that help identify and diagnose common issues quickly when problems occur. 
- Share an overview of performance or usage to other members of your team.
- As a shared workspace to build and test queries with team members.

## Creating a new dashboard

1. In Axiom, click on Dashboards

3. After creating the Dashboard, you will see the (+) button this will enable you to add your first charts to your dashboard. Click on it to build your first query.
