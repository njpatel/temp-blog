In this tutorial, I will show you how to ingress your logs from Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to Axiom. You will be able to stream and analyze your logs.

Weâ€™ll set up an AKS deployment from scratch and configure it to log directly to Axiom. If you already have an AKS deployment, feel free to skip to step 7.
